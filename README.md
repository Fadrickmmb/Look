This app was designed to help Brazilians find the best prices for Walt Disney World and Universal Parks Tickets.
With Puppeteer.js I scrape the most famous Brazilian Websites that sell those tickets and show them on a table. 
The user can see the price for the regular payment or for the monthly instalments, depending on the vendor, since some offer up to 12 instalments.

The data scraped with Puppeteer is "stored" in a JSON file, and the information is displayed on the tables.
Every time I run the program in my computer, a new JSON file is created and, when pushed to GitHub, the Website updates.
